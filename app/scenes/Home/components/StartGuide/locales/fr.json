    "StartGuide.toUseOmniBazaar2": "The marketplace matches buyers with sellers at a fraction of the cost of traditional e-commerce sites. Some optional marketplace services, such as escrow, may result in small fees when you buy or sell something. These fees are distributed to OmniBazaar users who provide the computer, network, escrow, and development services that make the marketplace possible. These fees are far less than the 10â€“15% fees charged by most e-commerce sites.",
    "StartGuide.aboutOmniCoinText1": "When you buy or sell using OmniCoins, you can use the \"SecureSend\" escrow service. SecureSend helps protect both buyers and sellers in long-distance transactions. OmniCoin also allows buyers and sellers to register reputation votes about each other. OmniCoin transactions \"clear\" approximately 120 times faster than Bitcoin transactions, and you can send payments to a user's name instead of of long string of numbers and letters.",
    "StartGuide.aboutOmniCoinText2": "OmniCoin is the official \"currency\" of the OmniBazaar marketplace. By default, when you use OmniCoin or bitcoins to buy or sell in the marketplace, there is a one percent (1%) fee that is paid by the seller. This fee is divided among service providers in the OmniBazaar marketplace. It is possible to \"opt-out\" of all OmniBazaar fees. But, you will find that the benefits of paying some small fees outweigh the costs in almost every case.",
